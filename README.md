Thanks to the guys at Stripe (http://stripe.com) for their amazing Stripe CTF 2.0 - I really enjoyed it and I'm sure many others did too.

I finally placed 15th on the flag leaderboard, and proud of it.

This repo represents my solutions to the CTF levels, as well as some extra post-level8 things I did, like an IRC bot to race people to capturing their flags.
