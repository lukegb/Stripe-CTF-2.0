Level 4 notes (level04)
=======================

This level involves the Karma Trader, a system that looks suspiciously like a mockery of Reddit. ;)

What's the vulnerability?
-------------------------

You can inject JavaScript into your password, then send karma to a user, displaying your password to them and executing your JavaScript in their webbrowser.

What's the complication?
------------------------

Not much, really.
